# Compojure-Template

A Leiningen template for web app projects using Compojure, Hiccup and Bootstrap. 

This tempate is based on [compojure-template](https://github.com/yogthos/compojure-template). 

## Usage

Run the following command to create a new Compojure project:

    lein new webapp <your project name>

To create a standalone executable from your project inside the project directory:

```bash
lein ring uberjar
```

You can then run the resulting jar as you would with any other Java executable:

```bash
java -jar target/myapp-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
