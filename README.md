# Compojure-Template

A Leiningen template for projects using [Compojure][1]. 

This tempate is a batteries included version of the official [compojure-template](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure-template). 
The template sets up several useful wrappers, such as the ones for serving static resources and handling mime types. 
It also provides a main for running standalone and a handler for WAR deployment which provides correct context resolution.

## Installation

If you're using Leiningen 2, add a plugin dependency on `[compojure-app/lein-template "0.2.7"]` to your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`.


If you're using Leiningen 1, you'll need to install the following plugins:

    lein plugin install lein-newnew 0.3.5
    lein plugin install compojure-app/lein-template 0.2.7


## Usage

Run the following command to create a new Compojure project:

    lein new compojure-app <your project name>

To build as standalone run:

```bash
lein uberjar
```
and you'll be able to run the resulting standalone jar as you would with any other executable Java jar:
```bash
java -jar target/myapp-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
